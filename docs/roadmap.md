## AI Systems Lab — Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the phased development of the AI Systems Lab project.
I have structured each phase in a manner that it builds production-ready skills and components. This follows a deep research into how most projects are developed.


### Phase 1: Python Engineering & Data Foundations
- Project structure and configuration
- Data ingestion and validation
- Reusable preprocessing pipelines
- Exploratory analysis in notebooks


### Phase 2: Machine Learning Systems
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model versioning
- Offline experimentation vs production code


### Phase 3: Model Serving & APIs
- FastAPI backend
- Prediction endpoints
- Schema validation
- Async processing


### Phase 4: NLP & Semantic Systems
- Text embeddings
- Semantic search
- Vector databases
- Document indexing

### Phase 5: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Context retrieval
- Prompt construction
- LLM integration
- Trustworthy responses

### Phase 6: Production Readiness
- Dockerization
- Testing
- Logging & monitoring
- CI/CD pipelines
